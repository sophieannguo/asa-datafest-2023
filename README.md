# American Statistical Association DataFest Analysis

This project was awarded "Best Use of External Data" at the ASA DataFest Competition hosted by the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University on March 24-26, 2023. Multiple datasets (that remain confidential per request of ASA) with 650K observations in total were analyzed. Our team implemented various mathematical techniques to innovate a variable that measured relative equity and to conduct sentiment analysis. Our results were summarized using geospatial data visualizations, pie charts, bar graphs, and a variety of other plots.
